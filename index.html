                <p>Somebody onece told me the world was macaroni, so I took a bite out of a tree. It tasted kind of funny so I spit it at a monkey and the monkey started shouting at me. 2000 years later that monkey was Darth Vader and he threw his light saber at me. It missed me by a mile and landed in the Nile and that's the end of the monkey story.</p>
